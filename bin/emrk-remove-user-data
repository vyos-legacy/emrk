# Why w* ?
# Because when you press the reset button, your old data
# is not removed. The old w/ dir is renamed to w${random string}/
# and the new one is created
# In most cases it's ok, but if you are going e.g. to sell
# the router on ebay or otherwise give it away to untrusted
# third party, transfer of config date and encryption key
# is a very bad idea
